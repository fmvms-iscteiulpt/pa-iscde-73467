# pa-iscde-73467
Repository for PA project

This is an academic project for the class Advanced Programming in the university ISCTE-IUL.
The project consists of a Task List plug-in for PIDESCO, using a specific IDE given to us for the project and it also uses some of its services.
The Task List plug-in comes with a Task List view and in it you see a table with all the tasks found in your workspace files, according to the tags you want the plugin to look for.
The plug-in has an extension point which lets anyone add the extension "taskextension" to their project. This extension let's you create "tasktags" and give them the "tagname" the plug-in will look for in the files, and populate in the Task List view. 

There is more information about the plug-in in the wiki and also an example and images of the Task List view in action:

Hope you enjoy the project.
