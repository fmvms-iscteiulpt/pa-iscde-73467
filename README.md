# pa-iscde-73467
Repository for PA project

This is an academic project for the class Advanced Programming in the university ISCTE-IUL.
This is a Task List plug-in for PIDESCO, using a specific IDE given to us and it uses some of its services.
The Task List plug-in comes with a Tasks view and in it you can create your own tasks, give them a description, their location and atribute them a tag.
The plug-in comes with an extension point which lets anyone create an extension "tasktag" and give that extension a "tagname" and with that the new task tag will now appear in the Tasks view for you to use.

If you're having some doubts understanding the plug-in check out the How to use wiki: https://github.com/fmvms-iscteiulpt/pa-iscde-73467/wiki/How-to-use

Hope you enjoy,
Have a good one :D
